## Project overview 
This project provides insights into understanding Spotify users' behaviour; it helps to understand how users interact with music and podcasts, choose subscription plans, and perceive the platform.
The dashboard highlights key patterns across age groups, devices, listening times and content preferences.  
The analysis delivers clear, actionable insights to support subscription strategy, content planning and overall user experience improvements.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
#### Data Preparation & Transformation

## Insights
#### Demographic and platform usage insights
- Across both music and podcasts, the 20-35 age band is the largest segment, at 45.5% (12,987 users), followed closely by the 12-20 age band (24.7%), summing over 70% of the total users. Users over 60 and children (6-12) represent the smallest fraction of the user base.
- The smartphone is the primary listening device (10,055 users, 35.2%), significantly outperforming laptops and speakers. Wearables are the least utilised device for Spotify consumption, with only 2.1% of users
- Music listening peaks at night (6,125 listeners, 21.5%), while the evening is surprisingly the least, with only 16.6% of listeners compared to morning and afternoon, suggesting a shift from active listening to other forms of entertainment (like video) during prime-time hours.
  
Overall, our users are majorly made up of young audiences, and smartphones are mainly used for music and podcast consumption. 

#### Music vs Podcast Behaviour
- About 16,779 users (58.8%) prefer music to podcasts, while 11,767 users (41.2%) prefer podcasts to music; this shows an even distribution between music and podcast lovers.
- About 70% of podcast listeners prefer podcasts that involve storytelling, interviews or discussions, showing a clear preference for human-centred content over purely educational or informal conversational styles. For the music listeners, 53% prefer melody, classical or pop, highlighting a strong leaning toward emotionally engaging and widely accessible music.
- Interestingly, the most frequent podcast listeners (”Daily”) account for only 2,000 users (17.8%), while “Rarely” and “Never” are the most common responses, indicating that while the quality is rated as “satisfactory” by 42.3%, the habit of listening to podcasts frequently is still developing.
- Podcast listeners show a strong preference for “any” host or “well-known individuals”, showing that content itself matters more than well-known personalities; however, being completely unknown still limits reach, which means strong content and smart positioning matter more than celebrity status alone.

Overall, while music is still the main focus, podcast listening shows a different pattern of engagement

#### Subscription and conversion analysis
- Out of all users, 12,520 (43.86%) are willing to subscribe, showing a strong interest in added value. However, the larger share, 16,026 users (56.14%), are not willing, suggesting price sensitivity or unmet expectations.
- 8,073 users (28.29%) choose “None” as their preferred plan, making free users the largest share, but paid plans combined clearly dominate (65.84%), with Student-plan 6,375 users (22.3%), Individual-plan 6,280 users (21.99%) and Family-plan 6,140 users (21.51%) almost carrying equal weight. Duo-plan remains the lowest with 1,678 users (5.88%).
- The distribution of users has been very steady; the numbers for “less than 6 months” through “more than 2 years” are almost identical (averaging about 7000 each). This shows steady growth, but long-term expansion may be slowing down.

In summary, the willingness to subscribe reveals a critical challenge for the platform

#### Quality and Satisfaction
- About 44% of users are satisfied or very satisfied, showing strong overall approval. However, 23% feel neutral, and nearly 32% are dissatisfied. Spotify is liked by many, but there is clear room to improve the experience when using Spotify.

In summary, most users have a positive view of Spotify. but opinions are mixed.


## Recommendations
#### Break the Subscription Barrier
Right now, most users are not paying. 56% won’t subscribe, and 28% are on no plan at all. Price is the main blocker.

- We can offer small, flexible options: Short passes, like a day pass or weekend ad-free plan, to let users pay only when it matters, like during a trip or a party. The popularity of the student plan already proves that users respond to cheaper options
- Reward free users: We can create a loyalty system where listening more or engaging with ads unlocks short ad-free sessions. This makes free users feel valued and slowly nudges them toward Premium.

#### Turn Podcast Listening into a Habit
Many users like podcasts, but very few listen every day, which shows the interest is there; the routine is not.

- Own the morning: we can push short 5–10 minute morning podcasts like news bites or quick stories. Since music dominates at night, podcasts can win the early hours.
- Let listeners shape the content: most podcast fans love interviews and stories. Simple polls and Q&A features that influence upcoming episodes can make listeners feel involved and keep them coming back.
- Use short clips to spark discovery: we can introduce a feed of short, scrollable podcast clips from popular interviews that fit with the interests of the youth.

#### Go After the Overlooked Older Audience 
Users aged **35–60** are under-represented, yet they often have more spending power.

- We can send recommendations of high-quality podcasts about 80s and 90s music, artist histories, or classical deep dives; this can be strongly appealing to this group.

#### Turn users into fans
A large group feels neutral or unhappy. That’s a risk, but also an opportunity

- We can create more content recommendations that match users’ listening habits; offering them similar shows and music they’re already enjoying and often listen to will keep them more engaged.
- Features like friend activity and shared listening sessions can bring back the feeling of connection, turning passive users into active advocates.

## Summary
Spotify is powered by a young, mobile-first audience that listens most at night. Many users enjoy podcasts, but few have turned them into a daily habit. The biggest challenge is conversion, with over half unwilling to pay, though the student plan shows that price can unlock demand. The key opportunity is to build stronger daily podcast habits and use smarter pricing to turn casual listeners into subscribers.
